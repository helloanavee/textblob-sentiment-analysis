## A Quick Overview
Sentiment Analysis, or Opinion Mining, stands as a pertinent and impactful application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. It is useful in many applications, including employee feedback assessments, e-commerce customer review analysis, and market research endeavors.

In this study, I created a **sentiment classification system for an e-commerce review dataset**. This was done with 2 methodologies: **with the library TextBlob, and without the library**. TextBlob is a dedicated Python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Throughout this exploration, I evaluate the merits and drawbacks of each technique, providing a comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and limitations.

### About the Project
