## A Quick Overview
Sentiment Analysis, or Opinion Mining, stands as a pertinent and impactful application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. It is useful in many applications, including employee feedback assessments, e-commerce customer review analysis, and market research endeavors.

In this study, I created a **sentiment classification system for an e-commerce review dataset**. This was done with 2 methodologies: **with the library TextBlob, and without the library**. TextBlob is a dedicated Python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Throughout this exploration, **I evaluate the merits and drawbacks of each technique**, providing a comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and limitations.

## Highlights
1. To compare, data was preprocessed similarly, and Naive Bayes was used for both TextBlob and Traditional ML.
2. Both models surpass the Proportion Chance Criterion (0.41), showcasing high accuracy.
3. Traditional ML (0.69 accuracy) slightly outperforms TextBlob (0.66 accuracy) and provides more descriptive features (words).
4. TextBlob simplifies text classification with ease and quick implementation.
5. Custom models offer greater flexibility, control, and visibility for text classification.
